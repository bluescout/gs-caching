== Purpose of this fork

I've forked this giude to reproduce https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8933 "Caching Abstraction ignores method name",
that was considered irrelevant by Spring developers and resolved with "Won't Fix", and @Cacheable still does not use method
name for cache key. 

This means methods with the same set of parameters will use the same cache entries despite name and return
type. For example, Details fetchPersonDetails(String ssn) and Roles fetchPersonRoles(String ssn) will produce ClassCastException
when annotated with @Cacheable and called one by one.

The workaround is to set key generation expression explicitely, as suggested in the comment https://jira.spring.io/browse/SPR-8933?focusedCommentId=77118&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-77118

== Original spring-guides documentation

This guide walks you through the process of enabling caching on a Spring managed bean.

== What you'll build

You'll build an application that enables caching on a simple book repository.


== What you'll need

:java_version: 1.8
include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/prereq_editor_jdk_buildtools.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/how_to_complete_this_guide.adoc[]


include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/hide-show-gradle.adoc[]

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/hide-show-maven.adoc[]

[[initial]]
== Create a book repository

First, let's create a very simple model for your book

`src/main/java/hello/Book.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/Book.java[]
----

And a repository for that model:

`src/main/java/hello/BookRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/BookRepository.java[]
----

You could have used {SpringData}[Spring Data] to provide an implementation of your
repository over a wide range of SQL or NoSQL stores, but for the purpose of this
guide, you will simply use a naive implementation that simulates some latency
(network service, slow delay, etc).

`src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java[]
----

`simulateSlowService` is deliberately inserting a five second delay into each `getByIsbn` call. This is an example that later on, you'll speed up with caching.

== Using the repository
Next, wire up the repository and use it to access some books.

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::initial/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

`@SpringBootApplication` is a convenience annotation that adds all of the following:

- `@Configuration` tags the class as a source of bean definitions for the application context.
- `@EnableAutoConfiguration` tells Spring Boot to start adding beans based on classpath settings, other beans, and various property settings. Technically, Spring Boot doesn't have anything to auto-configure when it comes to caching but a future version might.
- `@ComponentScan` tells Spring to look for other components, configurations, and services in the the `hello` package, allowing it to find the `SimpleBookRepository`.


If you try to run the application at this point, you'll notice it's quite slow even though you are retrieving
the exact same book several times.

----
2014-06-05 12:15:35.783  ... : .... Fetching books
2014-06-05 12:15:40.783  ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:15:45.784  ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:15:50.786  ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
----

As can be seen by the timestamps, each book took about five seconds to retrieve, even though it's the same title being repeatedly fetched.

NOTE: This application using Spring Boot's http://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/{spring_boot_version}/reference/htmlsingle/#boot-features-command-line-runner[CommandLineRunner].
This class makes it super simple to write code that runs once the application context has been configured.

== Enable caching

Let's enable caching on your `SimpleBookRepository` so that the books are cached within
the `books` cache.

`src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/SimpleBookRepository.java[]
----

You now need to enable the processing of the caching annotations

`src/main/java/hello/Application.java`
[source,java]
----
include::complete/src/main/java/hello/Application.java[]
----

The {EnableCaching}[`@EnableCaching`] annotation triggers a post processor that
inspects every Spring bean for the presence of caching annotations on public
methods. If such an annotation is found, a proxy is automatically created to intercept
the method call and handle the caching behavior accordingly.

The annotations that are managed by this post processor are {Cacheable}[`Cacheable`],
{CachePut}[`CachePut`] and {CacheEvict}[`CacheEvict`]. You can refer to the javadocs and
{documentation}[the documentation] for more details.

In its most basic setup, the annotation requires a {CacheManager}[`CacheManager`] to
serve as a provider for the relevant cache. In this example you use an implementation
that delegates to a `ConcurrentHashMap`. The {CachingConfigurer}[`CachingConfigurer`]
interface provides more advanced configuration options.

include::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spring-guides/getting-started-macros/master/build_an_executable_jar_with_both.adoc[]



== Test the application

Now that caching is enabled, you can execute it again and see the difference by adding additional
calls with or without the same isbn. It should make a huge difference.

----
2014-06-05 12:09:23.862 ... : .... Fetching books
2014-06-05 12:09:28.866 ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:09:33.867 ... : isbn-4567 -->Book{isbn='isbn-4567', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:09:33.867 ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:09:33.867 ... : isbn-4567 -->Book{isbn='isbn-4567', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:09:33.868 ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
2014-06-05 12:09:33.868 ... : isbn-1234 -->Book{isbn='isbn-1234', title='Some book'}
----

This excerpt from the console shows that the first time to fetch each title took five seconds the first time, but each subsequent call was near instantaneous.


== Summary

Congratulations! You've just enabled caching on a Spring managed bean.
